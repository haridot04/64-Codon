                <b> What is the relevance of 64 Codon? </b> <br>
                Research and development for new drugs and diagnostics need human biological samples (HBS) of multi ethnic origin. Due to sparse biobanks and insufficient samples of ethically collected, curated human biological samples from Indian ethnic population, our population is not well represented in the safety and efficacy testing in the research projects. <br>
                At 64 Codon, we engage with hospitals and laboratories across the country to collect human biological samples of multi ethnic Indian origin. Samples are collected after executing MoUs and Agreements, while ensuring anonymization of the samples, using proper tissue handling protocols, quality control, curation and retrieval. All the steps are carried out as per Ethical Committee guidelines and approvals. Prospective sample collection is carried out with comprehensive informed consent from patients, who have the right to withdraw consent at any point of time if needed. A certain portion of the stored human biological samples may be made available on free of cost basis for conducting collaborative basic science research. <br>
                We comply with New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules of 2019 and the ICMR guidelines

                64 Codon provides ethically collected and curated human biological samples from the multi ethnic Indian population. We also produce value-added products like - tissue micro array, DNA micro array, annotated images, whole slide images, FFPE with/without IHC and/or molecular data, etc. to cater to the researcher’s custom requirements. <br>
                We comply with New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules of 2019 and the ICMR guidelines.
